# CSI-107-Computer-Science-I-Computational-Physics
Course projects assigned in CSI 107 Computer Science I: Computational Physics (CSI 107) at Muhlenberg College.

## Course Description:
An introduction to Computer Science through the development of software to solve physics based problems. Emphasis is given to the implementation of models involving physics phenomena such as kinematics, the laws of motion, gravity, and momentum and energy conservation. Students learn to use basic software creation strategies, in designing and developing their physics simulations on their own and in collaboration with physics students. The course is intended for those with no prior experience in computer science but with a desire to hone problem solving and computing skills with a focus on physics. This course, in conjunction with PHY 1XX General Physics 1: Computational Physics, satisfies the IL requirement.

## Expected Course Outcomes: 
Course Outcomes are measurable achievements to be accomplished by the completion of the course. 

1.	Use problem-solving methods to develop and implement algorithms using a high-level programming language.
2.	Implement effective programs using the tools, abilities and concepts provided by Python, a widely used, structured programming language.
3.	Use features provided by science focused Python libraries such as matplotlib and scipy.
4.	Apply methods and algorithms to the basic techniques of design and implementation of physics models.
5.	Collaborate effectively with colleagues to accomplish specific goals.
6.	Design, code, debug, and document programs using good practices of programming style and structure.
7.	Adapt and apply modes of thinking from physics to better understand computer science principles, and to augment their problem-solving abilities.
